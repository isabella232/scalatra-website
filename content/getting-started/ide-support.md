Because Scalatra is a pure-Scala no-magic framework, Scala IDEs such as
[IntelliJ](https://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/SCA/Scala+Plugin+for+IntelliJ+IDEA),
and [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/) (Scala language server)
"understand" Scalatra and can assist your development.

For more information on how to use each of them, please refer to the official website at the link.
